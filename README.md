This project aims to develop a distributed image processing system using cloud computing 
technologies. The system will be implemented in Python, leveraging cloud-based virtual machines for 
distributed computing. The application will use OpenCL or MPI for parallel processing of image data.
Features and Specifications: <br>
• Distributed Processing: The system should be able to distribute image processing tasks across 
multiple virtual machines in the cloud. <br>
• Image Processing Algorithms: Implement various image processing algorithms such as filtering, 
edge detection, and color manipulation. <br>
• Scalability: The system should be scalable, allowing for the addition of more virtual machines as the 
workload increases. <br>
• Fault Tolerance: The system should be resilient to failures, with the ability to reassign tasks from 
failed nodes to operational ones.
